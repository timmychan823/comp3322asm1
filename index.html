              <p>To complete the Internship course <strong>COMP3412 / COMP3410</strong>, you are required to write a training report and submit the report on or before August 24, 2023 (Thursday). Please refer to the "Report and Assessment (<a href="/comp3410/info#Report">https://www.cs.hku.hk/comp3410/info#Report</a>)&rdquo; paragraph of the Information Page for information on the report format. If you need to extend the deadline because you haven't completed the internship, please send me an email to apply for it.</p>
              <p><strong>Submission of Internship Report</strong></p>
              <p>Please submit the training report via the Moodle System. Please log in to the Moodle System and check whether you can see the Course ID COMP3410_SB_2022 (<a href="https://moodle.hku.hk/course/view.php?id=102611">https://moodle.hku.hk/course/view.php?id=102611</a>). (Some of you may be enrolled in COMP3412; however, for ease of management, I added you to the COMP3410 Moodle site instead.) Please contact Anthony to set up the submission system if you cannot find the COMP3410_SB_2022 course ID in your Moodle course list.</p>
              <p><strong>Supervisor's Feedback Form</strong></p>
              <p>Please invite your supervisor to fill in the feedback form, which is available on the "Info for Employers" page and you or your supervisor can download the feedback form here: <a href="/about-student/hiring/info#feedback_form">https://www.cs.hku.hk/about-student/hiring/info#feedback_form</a></p>
              <p>Your supervisor can send the feedback form to me directly by (i) email (to ), (ii) fax (to 28584141). Sometimes, supervisors may pass the feedback form to you; in that case, please send the form to me by email (to ) or drop it to my mailbox at CS General Office.</p>
              <p><strong>Student's Feedback Form</strong></p>
              <p>There is a questionnaire (<a href="https://moodle.hku.hk/mod/questionnaire/view.php?id=2975580">https://moodle.hku.hk/mod/questionnaire/view.php?id=2975580</a>) for students to give us feedback on the internship arrangement. This is a standard questionnaire designed by the Faculty for all Engineering students to collect information for Outcome-based learning.</p>
              <p><strong>Placement Record</strong></p>
              <p>Some students still haven't submitted enough information for me to complete the approval process. Please log on to the placement system, check your status and my Remark, and upload or submit the required information to me as soon as possible.</p>

              <p>If you have already accepted a summer placement or 6/12-month placement but you haven't informed us, please log on to the Placement Database to enter/input your placement record. You can find the "My Placement Record" button on the menu pane on the Internship's Homepage.</p>
              <p>Please note that you have to input your placement information to your placement record <strong>before you start your placement OR at least NO LATER than 1/3 of the placement period after you started your placement</strong>. If you violate this guideline, your placement will not be approved and you shall fail the course and have to retake another internship next summer.</p>
              <p><strong>Placement Record</strong><br />To complete your placement record, please note that you <strong>MUST</strong> provide the following information:<br />. Company Name<br />. Job Title/Position (If the job title is too long, please just enter a short title here and provide the full title name in the 'Nature of work' field)<br />. Nature of work (Detailed Job description)<br />. Start Date<br />. End Date<br />. Working Location<br />. Payment Type - either paid or unpaid or honorarium<br />. Salary (if this is a paid internship or with honorarium)<br />. Appointment letter (upload the appointment letter or the contract as proof of your internship)<br />. Supervisor Name (you may enter that later after you have started working),<br />and<br />. Supervisor Telephone/Email (you may enter that later after you have started working).</p>
              <p>The reasons to collect the information are:<br />(1) We need the information to justify whether this post satisfies the Internship requirements. Some of the posts may be advertised through us; however, we do not have the details of the job with us when we screened those positions and<br />the actual job duties may be quite different from what has been advertised.<br />(2) For HKIE accreditation - We are using this database for showing to HKIE during accreditation.</p>
              <p>You may find that the status of your placement record is either <strong>NA / WAITING / INCOMPLETE / APPROVED</strong>. The initial status of every placement record is in NA, i.e., it is an empty record. Once you have inputted info to the placement record, the system will change the status to WAITING. After you have done this (or at least after adding the Job Description), press the "Submit" button to inform me, and I shall work on the screening. When you have entered sufficient information, with the document(s) to prove the internship, and the job satisfies the training requirements, I shall change the status of your placement record to APPROVED. If there is missing information, I shall change the status of your placement record to INCOMPLETE, for example, missing appointment document. In addition, I shall enter my remark in the "Remark" field to let you know what I am expecting you to follow up with.</p>
              <p>Please note that to fulfill the Internship requirement, <strong>it is important to register with the department once you have secured a placement. If we do not have a record of your placement with us, you could not pass the Internship course</strong>.</p>
              <p><strong>Govt STEM internship scheme</strong><br />When a company offers an internship to you under the ITC STEM scheme, please discuss with the company to use the first 4 weeks or the last 4 weeks of the internship to fulfill the Internship course and the remaining can be covered by the ITC STEM scheme. <strong>You should consult CEDARS career and placement section for the details.</strong> It would be better if the company can issue two appointment letters or contracts to you - one for the 4 weeks for the Internship course and the other for the remaining duration. If your internship is under this special arrangement, just input the start and end dates of the part of the internship that covers the course into the placement record. In addition to the job description, please also indicate that this is a separate part of the ITC STEM internship scheme in the 'Nature of Work' field. For the supervisor's feedback form, it would be better to invite the company to complete the feedback form upon the completion of the whole internship, i.e., including both periods.</p>
              <p><strong>"Letter to supervisor"</strong><br />As the supervisor's feedback report will contribute to the assessment of the course, we would like you to explicitly inform your supervisor of this requirement. To do so, we have designed a "Consent Form" for you to give to the supervisor to complete at the start of your internship. <strong>All students are required to email the completed Consent Form</strong>to the account once they start the placements. Here is the URL to download the Form:</p>
              <p><a href="/comp3410/info#Feedback">https://www.cs.hku.hk/comp3410/info#Feedback</a></p>
              <p><strong>Minimum Wages Ordinance</strong><br />Please note that some companies may request you to prove that the internship program is a component of the university degree curriculum. The govt. has prepared a standard form - "Confirmation of 'student intern' status under the Minimum Wage Ordinance (Cap. 608)" - for this purpose.<br />If the company requests you to provide them the proof in order to meet the hiring requirements, please follow this procedure:<br />(1) Download a copy of the form from here<br />(<a href="https://www.labour.gov.hk/eng/news/pdf/Letter_of_confirmation_student_interns.pdf">https://www.labour.gov.hk/eng/news/pdf/Letter_of_confirmation_student_interns.pdf</a>).<br />(2) Complete the form with the necessary information.<br />(3) Submit the form to CS general office (to Ms. Holly Ho)<br />(4) Holly will call you to collect the form once I have signed it.</p>
